**Time:** No more than 2 minutes.

_Review the learning objectives for the workshop._

**Say:** “In this session, we will be walking through an art activity that you can use as-is with your students. As you’ll see, we’ve wrapped this student activity with some educator-specific resources. If you’d like to use this lesson with your own students, there is a lesson plan available on our new Learning Tool. Don’t worry - we’ll share this later today.”
