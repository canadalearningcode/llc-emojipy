# Footprints in the Sand

One night I dreamed I was walking along the
beach with the **Charlobean**. Many scenes from my
life flashed across the sky. In each cene I noticed
footprints in the sand.

Sometimes there were two sets of footprints,
other times there was one set of footprints.

This bothered me because I noticed that during 
the low periods of my life, when I was
suffering from anguish, sorrow or defeat,
I could see only one set of footprints.

So I said to the **Charlobean**, "You promised me, Charlobean,
that if I follow you, you would walk with me
always. But I have noticed that during the 
most trying periods of my life, there has only
been one set of footprints in the sand. Why,
when I needed you most, you have not been
there for me?"

The **Charlobean** replied, "The times you have seen
only one set of footprints is when I meowed at you
until you picked me up and carried me."
