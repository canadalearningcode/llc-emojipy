## Workshop Title

**Emoji Art with Python and Processing**

_Go to delivery notes_

Emojis are a popular way to add additional meaning to text messages. Because they are often displayed as tiny images, the design of an emoji needs to be clear and relatively simple to be able to be effectively used. This means that many of them can be created out of a few simple, but purposeful, shapes. The Processing graphics library for Python provides us with an easy (and free!) way to get started creating images out of simple shapes.

## Why learn Python?

Because of its many areas of use, Python is a great programming language to learn. As a high-level programming language, Python code tends to be closer to human language and easier to understand than other, lower-level languages. The programming language itself also includes many built-in features and functions which let you focus on accomplishing whatever it is that you're trying to do, and there are many freely available Python libraries and modules to further extend the capabilities of the language. 

## The bottom line

From machine learning, to web development, to art, to automation, Python's popularity— ranked 4th on Stack Overflow's list of technologies used by professional developers— has only been growing. Regardless of your past experience with programming, now is a great time to get started with Python!
